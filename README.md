This program was written for the CS1122 course at Michigan Tech.<br/>
The syntax of the commands are as follows (All parts should be separated by a space):<br/>
- ‘=’ is always put at the beginning of a command. This tells the program to take the next given string and use it as the variable name.<br/>
- ‘!’ is always put at the beginning of a command. This tells the program to take the next given string, look into a Doom map and print out the value associated with the string.<br/>
- ‘+’ is for adding.<br/>
- ‘-’  is for subtracting.<br/>
- ‘*’ is for multiplying.<br/>
- ‘/’ is for dividing.<br/>
An example of a command that could be given to the program is:<br/>
	= var 3 5 +<br/>
This would add 3 and 5 and assign the result to a variable with the name “var.”<br/>
